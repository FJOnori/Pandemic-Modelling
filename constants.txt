beta = 0.211 for all time for now (contact number)
gamma = 1/12 for all time (infection duration in days)
sigma = 1/4 for all time (incubation duration in days)
epsilon = 1/365 (immunity loss rate in days)

UK pandemic model

BirthRate = 2.78363e-5
Take the average number of people born per day in 2020 and
divide it by the population by the end of 2020
https://www.statista.com/statistics/281296/uk-population/
https://www.statista.com/statistics/281981/live-births-in-the-united-kingdom-uk/

DeathRate = 2.48321e-5
Take the average number of people who died and 
divide by the total population who are not infected.
We assume that the number of people infected is small
compared to the total population.

ExposureRate => time dependant

ExposureRateV1+2 = ExposureRate*0.19/0.09
Based on a CDC study where participants where 
91% and 81% less likly to catch covid if they
were vaccinated
https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0607-mrna-reduce-risks.html

COVIDDeathRate = 8.95027e-3
Divide the culmative number of deaths
with the culmative number of cases
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths?country=~GBR

ImmunityLossRate = 2.73973e-3 = 1/365
Estimate based on a studies that claim immunity from
COVID-19 lasts at least 9-12 months
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(22)00584-9/fulltext

InfectionRate = 0.17857 = 1/5.6
Estimate based on studies that claim that 
the minimum mean incubation period is 5.6 days
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2254887420301466

RecoveryRate = 1/10 = 0.1
Esimate based on an aritcle from John Hopkins
https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/diagnosed-with-covid-19-what-to-expect

RecoveryRateV1+2 = 0.167 + 0.25 = 1/6 + 1/4
Esitmate based on reserch by the CDC

VaccinationRate1+2 => time dependant
Based on vaccinations downloaded from our world in DeathRate
